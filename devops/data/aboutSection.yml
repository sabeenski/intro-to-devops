  ## About me
  
  I am an aspiring full-stack developer who has a background in business and hotel management. Two years ago, I decided to enter into IT because I have always loved problem solving and building things myself. I used to participate to many tech events that were held in Helsinki and I was amazed by the power of developers who brought great ideas into reality. *I also wanted to have that super power.* Moreover, I saw first-hand that the demands for software engineering job is huge.

  
  Currently, I am working as a developer in Helsinki. My team consists of 6 people and we are a part of self-organizing team where we get responsibilities, full ownership of our tasks and freedom to learn and do things in the best way we think. I am learning a lot at work and obviously my learning curve has been tremendous since I joined this company. 


  My job includes a variety of tasks such as building web applications from the ground up, fixing bugs, maintaining the applications as well as planning, requirement gathering and software designing.

  ### I build intuitive web interfaces.

  I love to build simple and easy-to-use applications. In my opinion, it is super important to think about users when building any application. It should be as intuitive as possible. Users should not require to put lot of effort in the site and the interactions should come naturally. 
  I always try my best to make good user interface with the best user experience.
