# Intro-to-DevOps

This project was built as a part of *Intro to DevOps* course organized by Aalto University. The aim was to learn and implement a continuous deployment pipeline by using GitHub Actions. The project uses Hugo, which is a static site generator.

The site is deployed [here](https://cs-ej4104-fall-2020.github.io/sabeenski-project/). A workflow is configured to automate the deployment whenever any changes is pushed to the master branch. The site is published via another branch. The workflow to build and deploy site to Github Pages is defined in a YAML file. 
You can see it [here](https://github.com/sabeenski/intro-to-devops/blob/master/.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml).

The contents in the website are added according to the project requirements needed to pass the course.
