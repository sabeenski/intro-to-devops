<p>Despite using GitHub for sometime now, I wasn&rsquo;t aware about the GitHub actions workflow which seems to be very handy. Through this course, I learned about this very useful concept. GitHub Actions is used to automate software development tasks. They are event driven -  allowing developers to run a series of commands after certain event has occured. These workflows are defined in a YAML file and what I found to be the best part is that one repository can contain one to many workflows. We can set up our workflow depending on our needs - when do we want to trigger the workflow, we can specify branch names, install dependencies, execute tests and so on.  This project helped me to implement a simple workflow and obviously I can build more on to this knowledge in future by also writing my own test cases.</p>
<p>The next thing I learned from this course is about <strong>Hugo</strong> which is a static website generator and uses <em>Markdown</em> files to generate contents. Using Hugo was one of the challenging parts in this project because of the theme specific requirements. Adding a theme and building the project was not always a straight forward process &ndash; but after trying to figure out and solve the issues that <em>git</em> was referring to &ndash; I also learned about <em>submodules</em> in git, which is good afterall. Otherwise, the project went quite smooth. Personally, I felt that having an otion to use  standard <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> files would still save some of the time while still reaching the main goals of this course. Instead, I think including some materials in a chosen testing framework would be really nice and fit well to the course objectives. The project could then ask students to write some test cases in addition to implement a workflow with GitHub Actions. This way, students could learn to build an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline - which is what <strong>DevOps</strong> is all about.</p>
