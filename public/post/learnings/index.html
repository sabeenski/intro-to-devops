<p>Having worked as a developer for a bit more than a year now, I have been always keen on industry best practices and how development team can work in an efficient way. DevOps has been a buzz word nowadays and I see many vacancies that are looking for developers with Devops mindset. My current team used to be quite small and we don&rsquo;t have any CI/CD pipelines in place yet. We do tests and deployment manually and I have found this to be quite cumbersome. As the team is growing, we are incorporating more development tools in our workflow and I am really interested in building the CI/CD pipeline for our development tasks.</p>
<p>This course seems to be a great starting point for someone like me who is keen on learning the basics of DevOps. I wanted to learn more about devops both theoretically and practically. The course included some interesting videos that introduced students with the fundamentals of DevOps and its advantages for software businesses. From this course, I was expecting to learn about automation tools, difference between continuous deployment and continous delivery as well as some hands on knowlege on implementing continuous deployment pipeline. The course also included tutorials on version control with Git. I have been using GitHub before, so I was pretty familiar to this. However, I believe that for those who haven&rsquo;t used version control, the course provides pretty good base for getting started.</p>
<p>Finally, the hands-on project provided beneficial knowledge on building continous development with GitHub actions. This was one of the main reasons why I decided to take this course.</p>
