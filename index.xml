      <description>Despite using GitHub for sometime now, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware about the GitHub actions workflow which seems to be very handy. Through this course, I learned about this very useful concept. GitHub Actions is used to automate software development tasks. They are event driven - allowing developers to run a series of commands after certain event has occured. These workflows are defined in a YAML file and what I found to be the best part is that one repository can contain one to many workflows.</description>

      <description>Having worked as a developer for a bit more than a year now, I have been always keen on industry best practices and how development team can work in an efficient way. DevOps has been a buzz word nowadays and I see many vacancies that are looking for developers with Devops mindset. My current team used to be quite small and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any CI/CD pipelines in place yet.</description>
