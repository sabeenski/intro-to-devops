  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sabina and I am currently working as a junior developer. Two years ago, I decided to switch my career to tech due to its versatile scope and my growing interests in software development. Problem-solving and being able to build stuffs give me immense happiness and I love that I can play a role of investigator while debugging. </p>
  <p>Most of my time at work, I try to investigate and analyze why certain things are behaving in a certain way. Basically finding out <strong>WHY?</strong> Happiness is when I figure out the reason and am able to solve that specific problem I am working on. Must I say, it's not always an easy road and happy stars..sometimes being stuck in hours for same problem can bring its own frustrations but eventually it has always worked out at the end. :)</p>

    Despite using GitHub for sometime now, I wasn&rsquo;t aware about the GitHub actions workflow which seems to be very handy. Through this course, I learned about this very useful concept. GitHub Actions is used to automate software development tasks. They are event driven - allowing developers to run a series of commands after certain event has occured. These workflows are defined in a YAML file and what I found to be the best part is that one repository can contain one to many workflows.  <a href="/sabeenski-project/post/learnings/">Read More...</a>

    Having worked as a developer for a bit more than a year now, I have been always keen on industry best practices and how development team can work in an efficient way. DevOps has been a buzz word nowadays and I see many vacancies that are looking for developers with Devops mindset. My current team used to be quite small and we don&rsquo;t have any CI/CD pipelines in place yet.  <a href="/sabeenski-project/post/devops/">Read More...</a>
